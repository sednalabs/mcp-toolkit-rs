# Dependency Governance

This starter ships a lightweight dependency-governance lane so a new public MCP
server can begin with the same basic posture as `mcp-toolkit-rs`:

- `cargo-deny` is blocking for advisories, licenses, bans, and sources.
- `cargo-audit` is blocking for RustSec advisories.
- `cargo-outdated` is advisory by default and blocking only when
  `STRICT_OUTDATED=1`.
- `scripts/rmcp_macro_runtime_pin_check.py` ensures any direct `rmcp-macros`
  dependency stays aligned with the pinned `rmcp` runtime, while allowing the
  recommended `rmcp`-with-`macros` setup.

Install the local tooling with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-deny cargo-audit cargo-outdated
```

Run the full check with:

```bash
./scripts/dependency_governance_check.sh
```

Use the stricter stale-dependency mode only when you want dependency freshness
to block the lane:

```bash
STRICT_OUTDATED=1 ./scripts/dependency_governance_check.sh
```

When you add a new direct dependency or make a major upgrade, include a short
PR note that records why the crate is needed, which safer alternatives were
considered, and how you would roll the change back.
